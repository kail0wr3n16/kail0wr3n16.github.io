    <h1>Privacy Policy for Verbum</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 18, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Verbum is a Latin to English dictionary app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how our app works.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Camera Access</h3>
    <p>Verbum accesses your device's camera to scan and recognize Latin text. All text recognition is performed locally on your device using Google ML Kit. <strong>No images or photos are uploaded to external servers.</strong> Camera data is processed entirely on-device and is not stored.</p>

    <h3>Dictionary Lookups</h3>
    <p>When you look up a Latin word, the word you searched is sent to our dictionary service to retrieve the definition. We do not log or store your search history on our servers.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information (name, email, etc.)</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage analytics</li>
        <li>Photos or images from your camera</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>Google ML Kit:</strong> We use Google ML Kit for on-device text recognition. This processing happens entirely on your device. For more information, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms">Google ML Kit Terms</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Verbum may store your preferences and recent searches locally on your device. This data is not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Verbum does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The app is suitable for users of all ages as it does not collect any personal data.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store personal data on external servers, there is minimal risk to your privacy. All sensitive processing (text recognition) occurs locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
