    <h1>Verbum Support</h1>

    <p>
        Verbum is a Latin to English dictionary app designed to help you look up words,
        understand their meanings, and see basic grammatical information.
        It focuses on individual words rather than full sentence translation.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>How do I scan text?</strong><br>
            Tap the camera button and point your device at printed Latin text.
            Clear lighting and sharp focus work best.
            After scanning, tap or select the words you want to look up.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Why wasn’t my word found?</strong><br>
            Verbum works best with dictionary (base) forms.
            Try entering the nominative singular for nouns or the present active infinitive for verbs.
            Words may also fail if they include enclitics (such as <em>-que</em>),
            are proper names, abbreviations, or uncommon spellings.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Does Verbum translate full sentences?</strong><br>
            No. Verbum is designed for word-by-word lookup and vocabulary support.
            It does not provide full grammatical parsing or sentence-level translations.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Why doesn’t scanning always work?</strong><br>
            Text recognition depends on image quality.
            Handwritten text, unusual fonts, low contrast, or poor lighting may reduce accuracy.
